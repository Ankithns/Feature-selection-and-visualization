# Feature Selection and Visualization

The project aims to classify the cellular phenotypes, the input is the SQLite database file obtained from Cellprofiler analysis. 

To execute the project, go to the file named FeatureVisualization.ipnyb from the Jupyter Notebook. To make each python code snippet easy to visualize the python file is in the notebook form (.ipyb) instead of the .py extension file. Please do note that the dataset is a .db extension file. It is connected and loaded via SQLite.
